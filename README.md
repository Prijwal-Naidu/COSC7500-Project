# Options-Vol_C-

This is a project I built to demonstrate the basics of option pricing in C++ to University Students and a UNIT event.
The file Asian.cpp allows the pricing of arithmetic Asian options
The file impvol.cpp allows the calculation of finding ImpVol using Newton's Method and interpolation
The file MC.cpp allows the pricing of options using the Monte Carlo Method with Variance Reduction
The file optionsprice.cpp combines this all together and provides the price of an option by extrapolating the impvol
The file Functions.h is a header file that contains all the logic and computations behind the pricing of all the options
The file spline.h is a header file that allows the usage of the spline method in C++. This header file is note my code.
